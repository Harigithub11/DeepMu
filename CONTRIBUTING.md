# Contributing to DocuMind AI Research Agent

We love your input! We want to make contributing to DocuMind AI as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DeepMu.git
   cd DeepMu
   ```

2. **Set up environment:**
   ```bash
   cd project
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start development services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d qdrant redis elasticsearch
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

5. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Formatting
```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install black isort flake8 mypy

# Format code
black .
isort .

# Check linting
flake8 .

# Type checking
mypy .
```

### Documentation
- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Update API documentation in `docs/API.md` for any API changes
- Add examples for new features

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Write integration tests for new endpoints
- Maintain test coverage above 90%
- Use meaningful test names that describe what is being tested

## Commit Messages

Use clear and meaningful commit messages:

```
feat: add hybrid search functionality
fix: resolve GPU memory leak in AI service
docs: update API documentation for search endpoints
test: add integration tests for document upload
refactor: optimize vector search performance
```

### Commit Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## Issue Reporting
